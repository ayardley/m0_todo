This is a minimal repository that contains a todo list for M0, a minimal virtual machine that is being designed as a foundation for Parrot.  This todo list is probably not of general interest, but it's being made public so that any Parrot developer can add and remove tasks.  If you're interested, please contact cotto or dukeleto on #parrot on irc.parrot.org.
